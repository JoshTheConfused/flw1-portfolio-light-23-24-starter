        <p class="project-description">Using Python and online text databases, this program generates hundreds, or even thousands of sonnets, which can be grouped around certain general word-themes, all without the use of any kind of neural network or AI. They might not make the most sense, but that's why they're for you to interpret.

        <p class="project-description">This is my implementation of the basic functionality of the famous A* pathfinding algorithm, based off of the method outlined in Sebastian Lague's video on the topic. It allows the user to define a start and end point, and a set of walls to restrict the path before the program solves it.

        <p class="project-description">This is a project I made for my math class in the first semester of my junior year. The problem asked about the length of a laser bouncing inside a rectangular room at 45 degree angles, which I decided to visualize after solving it on paper.
