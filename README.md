This is a website/portfolio which goes over a lot of what I do (at the time of creating this, at least), including a general desription of some hobbies and links to various projects.
It was created under the Code Nation fellowship at Etsy in New York, which provided some basic structural code and taught me how to create almost all of this.
It is also important to mention that the background animation on every page uses Wave Function Collapse (https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), which I coded most of by following along to the video on the algorithm by The Coding Train(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM).
